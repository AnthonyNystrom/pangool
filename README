README

Currently we use Jekyll (https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) to
maintain the documentation site for Pangool.  If you do not have Jekyll
installed on your machine, you can do the following to get it installed:

  $ sudo get install jekyll

After you make any documentation changes, you can start the site using
the following command to check if everything looks OK:

  $ jekyll --server

The Pangool home page will be running on:

  http://localhost:4000
